		Diabetes mellitus is a disease associated with abnormally high levels of
		blood glucose due to a lack of insulin. Combining an insulin pump and
		continuous glucose monitor with a control algorithm to deliver insulin is an
		alternative to patient self-management of insulin doses to control blood
		glucose levels in diabetes mellitus patients. In this work, we propose a
		closed-loop control for blood glucose levels based on deep reinforcement
		learning. We describe the initial evaluation of several alternatives
		conducted on a realistic simulator of the glucoregulatory system and propose
		a particular implementation strategy based on reducing the frequency of the
		observations and rewards passed to the agent, and using a simple reward
		function. We train agents with that strategy for three groups of patient
		classes, evaluate and compare it with alternative control baselines. Our
		results show that our method is able to outperform baselines as well as
		similar recent proposals, by achieving longer periods of safe glycemic state
		and low risk.

		The significant increase in large-scale wildfire events in recent decades,
		caused primarily by climate change, has resulted in a growing number of
		aerial resources being used in suppression efforts. Present-day management
		lacks efficient and scalable algorithms for complex aerial resource
		allocation and scheduling for the extinction of such fires, which is crucial
		to ensuring safety while maximizing the efficiency of operations. In this
		work, we present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization model
		tailored to large-scale wildfires for the daily scheduling of aerial
		operations. The main objective is to achieve a prioritized target water flow
		over all areas of operation and all time periods. Minimal target completion
		across individual areas and time periods and total water output are also
		maximized as secondary and ternary objectives, respectively. An efficient and
		scalable multi-start heuristic, combining a randomized greedy approach with
		simulated annealing employing large neighborhood search techniques, is
		proposed for larger instances. A diverse set of problem instances is
		generated with varying sizes and extinction strategies to test the
		approaches. Results indicate that the heuristic can achieve (near)-optimal
		solutions for smaller instances solvable by the MILP, and gives solutions
		approaching target water flows for larger problem sizes. The algorithm is
		parallelizable and has been shown to give promising results in a small number
		of iterations, making it applicable for both night-before planning and, more
		time-sensitive, early-morning scheduling.

  abstract={Patients with Type 1 diabetes must closely monitor their blood glucose levels and inject insulin to control them. Automated glucose control methods that remove the need for human intervention have been proposed, and reinforcement learning has been used recently as an effective control method in simulation environments. However, its real-world application would require trial and error interaction with patients. As an alternative, offline reinforcement learning does not require interaction with humans and initial studies suggest promising results can be obtained with offline datasets, similar to classical machine learning algorithms. However, its application to glucose control has not yet been evaluated. In this study, we evaluated two offline reinforcement learning algorithms for blood glucose control and discussed their potential and shortcomings. We also evaluated the influence on training and performance of the method that generates the training datasets, as well as the influence of the type of trajectories used (single-method or mixed trajectories), the quality of the trajectories, and the size of the datasets. Our results show that one of the offline reinforcement learning algorithms evaluated, Trajectory Transformer, is able to perform at the same level as commonly used baselines such as PID and Proximal Policy Optimization.},

		The application of data-driven methods is expected to play an increasingly

		skills to develop these models and interpret its output is preventing a wider

		ORIENTATE, a software for automated application of machine learning
		classification algorithms by clinical practitioners lacking specific
		technical skills. ORIENTATE allows the selection of features and the target
		variable, then automatically generates a number of classification models and
		cross-validates them, finding the best model and evaluating it. It also
		implements a custom feature selection algorithm for systematic searches of
		the best combination of predictors for a given target variable. Finally, it
		outputs a comprehensive report with graphs that facilitates the explanation
		of the classification model results, using global interpretation methods, and
		an interface for the prediction of new input samples. Feature relevance and
		interaction plots provided by ORIENTATE allow to use it for statistical
		inference, which can replace and/or complement classical statistical studies.

		In this paper, we investigate a novel problem for dimensioning optical

		the TRSA problem with and without fault tolerance for arbitrary network
		topologies. The algorithms are used to evaluate potential cost benefits of
		P2MP transceivers for different IP densities and loads in a case study on a

		Time series sensor data classification tasks often suffer from training data
		scarcity issue due to the expenses associated with the expert-intervened
		annotation efforts. For example, Electrocardiogram (ECG) data classification
		for cardio-vascular disease (CVD) detection requires expensive labeling
		procedures with the help of cardiologists. Current state-of-the-art
		algorithms like deep learning models have shown outstanding performance under
		the general requirement of availability of large set of training examples. In
		this paper, we propose Shapley Attributed Ablation with Augmented Learning:
		ShapAAL, which demonstrates that deep learning algorithm with suitably
		selected subset of the seen examples or ablating the unimportant ones from
		the given limited training dataset can ensure consistently better
		classification performance under augmented training. In ShapAAL, additive
		perturbed training augments the input space to compensate the scarcity in
		training examples using Residual Network (ResNet) architecture through
		perturbation-induced inputs, while Shapley attribution seeks the subset from
		the augmented training space for better learnability with the goal of better
		general predictive performance, thanks to the ``efficiency'' and ``null
		player'' axioms of transferable utility games upon which Shapley value game
		is formulated. In ShapAAL, the subset of training examples that contribute
		positively to a supervised learning setup is derived from the notion of
		coalition games using Shapley values associated with each of the given
		inputs' contribution into the model prediction. ShapAAL is a novel push-pull
		deep architecture where the subset selection through Shapley value
		attribution pushes the model to lower dimension while augmented training
		augments the learning capability of the model over unseen data. We perform
		ablation study to provide the empirical evidence of our claim and we show
		that proposed ShapAAL method consistently outperforms the current baselines
		and state-of-the-art algorithms for time series sensor data classification
		tasks from publicly available UCR time series archive that includes different
		practical important problems like detection of CVDs from ECG data.

		Climate change is increasing temperatures and causing periods of water
		scarcity in arid and semi-arid climates. The agricultural sector is one of
		the most affected by these changes, having to optimise scarce water
		resources. An important phenomenon within the water cycle is the evaporation
		from water reservoirs, which implies a considerable amount of water lost
		during warmer periods of the year. Indeed, evaporation rate forecasting can
		help farmers grow crops more sustainably by managing water resources more
		efficiently in the context of precision agriculture. In this work, we expose
		an interpretable machine learning approach, based on a multivariate decision
		tree, to forecast the evaporation rate on a daily basis using data from an
		Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, which is deployed on a real
		irrigated plot located in Murcia (southeastern Spain). The climate data
		collected feed the models that provide a forecast of evaporation and a
		summary of the parameters involved in this process. Finally, the results of
		the interpretable presented model are validated with the best literature
		models for evaporation rate prediction, i.e., Artificial Neural Networks,
		obtaining results very similar to those obtained for them, reaching up to
		0.85R2 and 0.6MAE. Therefore, in this work, a double objective is faced: to
		maintain the performance obtained by the models most frequently used in the
		problem while maintaining the interpretability of the knowledge captured in
		it, which allows better understanding the problem and carrying out
		appropriate actions.

		Encouraged by the European Union, all European countries need to enforce

		The temperature of indoor spaces is at the core of highly relevant topics

		to this, there is scientific evidence that the mental models of how users
		understand the operation of the billions of air-conditioning machines around

		The electric grid is undertaking a change of paradigm. New requirements such
		as the high power loads of Electric Vehicles' charging are putting pressure
		on grids, and the popularisation of the figure of the prosumers, are creating
		new needs on the management of the system. Although the investment on
		infrastructure is one of the ways of alleviating the arrival of this new
		loads, the existence of smart controls, actuators and smart appliances opens
		also the door for demand modification. The so called Demand Response Events
		are strategies to reallocate the loads of the consumers, so the power demand
		is shifted towards times less critical for the grid. Some smart appliances
		can be considered as shiftable. The operation of them can be rescheduled to
		other times and still provide their services. On this paper we suggest an
		optimisation methodology consisting on a parallelisation method together with
		a generic algorithm that would allow an overlooking controller (such as
		aggregator or DSO) reduce the power peaks even with a large number of devices
		to control. The research here presented has looked for the smallest group
		size at which the optimisation is more effectible done in parallel groups
		rather than on a single large set. With this, we eliminated the exponential
		growth of the computational effort that the optimisation algorithm would need
		to do organising all devices in one go. The method achieves a computational
		time reduction of 80\%, and it is only worsening the reduction of peak by
		2.8\% compared to an optimisation with a complete set.

		Future generations of mobile networks will require increased backhaul
		capacity to connect a massive amount of small cells (SCs) to the network.
		Since having an optical connection to each SC might be infeasible, mmWave
		links are an interesting alternative due to their large available bandwidth.
		An advantage of a wireless backhaul is that the topology can be reconfigured
		to adapt to changing traffic demands, new operator policies, or to rapidly
		overcome network failures. In this work, we investigate the problem of
		orchestrating the reconfiguration of mmWave wireless backhaul networks with
		mechanically steerable antennas assuming green backhaul operation where nodes
		are turned off when not in use. The orchestration involves scheduling and
		coordinating the powering on/off of nodes, the rotation of antennas to
		achieve alignment for link establishment, and setting up and tearing down
		links to minimize packet loss during the reconfiguration. We model the
		problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) for optimal orchestration
		and propose a sub-optimal reduced MILP for larger instances. Numerical
		results for different topologies using a realistic traffic trace indicate
		that optimizing reconfiguration orchestration can significantly reduce packet
		loss in comparison to a straightforward reconfiguration approach, enabling a
		smooth transition between target mmWave backhaul topologies.

In this paper, we perform a case study on fault tolerant ring networks with more general traffic profiles to assess the benefits of P2MP optics for alternative network scenarios such as those appearing in metro rings. We propose mixed integer linear programming formulations for multilayer capacity planning to minimize total transceiver costs, considering both point-to-point and P2MP transceivers, as well as a heuristic approach for the more complex P2MP case. Results indicate that P2MP optics can bring several advantages for all tested traffic profiles, ranging from pure uniform flows to mostly H\&S. Transceiver cost savings are achieved in various cases, greater at higher network loads and for traffic patterns that are mostly H\&S. Results also show that P2MP optics prompt a multilayer redesign of the network with significantly reduced spectrum usage and a reduced number of IP hops, resulting in lower optical--electronic--optical and IP processing latency and lower IP layer equipment costs for all traffic profiles.},

		In vehicular communications, the increase of the channel load caused by

		Results obtained were compared with other traditional solutions, revealing
		that our approach, called SSFA, is able to keep a certain fraction of the

		Telecom operators' infrastructure is sustained by optical communication
		networks that provide the means for exchanging large amounts of information,
		which is essential for many modern society needs. Optical networks are
		characterized by rapid breakthroughs in a variety of technologies.
		Relevantly, the last decade encompassed remarkable advances in optical
		networks' subfields of signal processing, electronics, photonics,
		communications, protocols, and control-plane architectures. Hence, these
		advancements unlocked unprecedented transmission capacities,
		reconfigurability and programmability, entailing an evolution in the way
		which networks were designed, planned, and analyzed. In this paper, we review
		the historical status of optical planning and design tools by focusing on the
		major enabling technologies and relevant landmarks of the last decade(s). We
		begin by pinpointing the major breakthroughs in the optical data plane,
		estimation models capturing the transmission medium behavior and the control
		plane. We then distil the implications that these advancements entail in the
		landscape of optical network design and analysis tools, which commonly sit
		``on top'' of the control plane or as a fully separated entity. Then, we
		speculate with our view for the future, in which automatic validation of
		optical network operations and dimensioning jointly with learning/artificial
		intelligence mechanisms will permit zero-touch optical networking: i.e.
		updating, provisioning, and upgrading network capacities, by means of
		automation with minimal human intervention. We conclude with a proposal of an
		architecture that encompasses data and control planes in a comprehensive
		manner for paving the way towards zero-touch optical networking.

		The adoption of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP-WAN) for interconnecting

abstract = {The digitalization of cities and the development of smart, green, and integrated transport are societal challenges to transform cities into places with good quality of life now and in the future. The Internet of Things (IoT) comes with new advances to connect a multitude of sensing devices and even actuators, and they are presenting the cornerstone of Smart City deployments worldwide. So far, these advances have focused on static sensors in scenarios such as gardens, smart lighting, climate monitoring, or traffic management. However, moving sensors could rise the monitoring capabilities of smart cities to the next level, helping to better reflect the status of large areas without replicating fixed stations. This work proposes taking advantage of urban vehicles and, especially, personal mobility vehicles (PMVs), to implement such a perspective. Hence, a low-cost and energy-aware onboard unit (OBU) is designed to gather environmental data and support sustainable mobility applications. This on-board platform is provided with Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) communication technologies, enabling an Internet connection following an IoT scheme. The unit is equipped with sensors to measure air pollution in terms of NO2, CO, SO2, O3 and PMx, noise, and weather parameters. While moving across the city, PMVs mounting this device can collect data in a crowdsensing scheme. This data feed is complemented by a set of wireless traffic sensors, and they are subject to intelligent processing to monitor pollution and mobility parameters. For this, a back-end software module is powered with temporal series analysis to generate predictions based on tendencies detected in both pollution and mobility values. A front-end Web application has been implemented to show all past, current, and predicted data, offering functionalities to monitor urban mobility, minimize travel times, detect pollution areas, and recommend healthy routes across streets with low contamination levels.}

This is the case of vehicles. The COVID-19 pandemic has remarked the importance of measuring air quality indoors, for instance. With the aim of solving this two-fold issue, this work proposes an in-cabin and outdoor air pollution monitoring system to assure healthy conditions when travelling, driving and operating vehicles, and to analyse the evolution of environmental parameters in cities. This effort is carried out exploiting distributed computing with micro-services, betting for an on-board hardware solution provided with sensors for measuring particulate matter, CO, CO2, NO2, O3, temperature and humidity. While basic data pre-processing is carried out in this acquisition unit, edge processing is performed on a single board computer aboard and intermediary communication nodes in the network path from the vehicle to the cloud. Vehicle connectivity is provided by 4G cellular and Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWAN) networks. Global environmental perception is acquired by cloud-based software powered by machine learning and time series analysis. The whole solution has been validated and tested in the city of Cartagena (Spain), with good performance in terms of data collection, communication links and service offered.}

  abstract={Mobile networks are facing an unprecedented demand for high-speed connectivity originating from novel mobile applications and services and, in general, from the adoption curve of mobile devices. However, coping with the service requirements imposed by current and future applications and services is very difficult since mobile networks are becoming progressively more heterogeneous and more complex. In this context, a promising approach is the adoption of novel network automation solutions and, in particular, of zero-touch management techniques. In this work, we refer to zero-touch management as a fully autonomous network management solution with human oversight. This survey sits at the crossroad between zero-touch management and mobile and wireless network research, effectively bridging a gap in terms of literature review between the two domains. In this paper, we first provide a taxonomy of network management solutions. We then discuss the relevant state-of-the-art on autonomous mobile networks. The concept of zero-touch management and the associated standardization efforts are then introduced. The survey continues with a review of the most important technological enablers for zero-touch management. The network automation solutions from the RAN to the core network, including end-to-end aspects such as security, are then surveyed. Finally, we close this article with the current challenges and research directions.},

Performance of 5G New Radio (5G-NR) is expected to address bandwidth and delay requirements of services for autonomous vehicles. This is the theory and what particular research works have showed through simulation or limited prototypes. On the contrary, this work focuses on evaluating real 5G deployments (including 5G-NR) of network operators in CCAM scenarios, with particular emphasis on cross-border settings and service continuity under inter-operator handovers. The paper presents an evaluation platform to gather cross-layer measurements, homogenise results, perform comparative assessment of figures of merit, and calculate network and CCAM key performance indicators (KPIs). The platform is evaluated through implementing a use case for autonomous overtaking, involving two 5G-NR operator deployments at the Spanish-Portuguese border. Results reveal good network performances and correct operation of the service, thanks to 5G-NR and edge servers, although significant impact of handovers is detected on network and overtaking KPIs.}

ABSTRACT = {Advances in new technologies are allowing any field of real life to benefit from using these ones. Among of them, we can highlight the IoT ecosystem making available large amounts of information, cloud computing allowing large computational capacities, and Machine Learning techniques together with the Soft Computing framework to incorporate intelligence. They constitute a powerful set of tools that allow us to define Decision Support Systems that improve decisions in a wide range of real-life problems. In this paper, we focus on the agricultural sector and the issue of sustainability. We propose a methodology that, starting from times series data provided by the IoT ecosystem, a preprocessing and modelling of the data based on machine learning techniques is carried out within the framework of Soft Computing. The obtained model will be able to carry out inferences in a given prediction horizon that allow the development of Decision Support Systems that can help the farmer. By way of illustration, the proposed methodology is applied to the specific problem of early frost prediction. With some specific scenarios validated by expert farmers in an agricultural cooperative, the benefits of the methodology are illustrated. The evaluation and validation show the effectiveness of the proposal.},

ABSTRACT = {5G/Beyond 5G (B5G) networks provide connectivity to many heterogeneous devices, raising significant security and operational issues and making traditional infrastructure management increasingly complex. In this regard, new frameworks such as Anastacia-H2020 or INSPIRE-5GPlus automate the management of next-generation infrastructures, especially regarding policy-based security, abstraction, flexibility, and extensibility. This paper presents the design, workflow, and implementation of a security solution based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), able to extend 5G/B5G security framework capabilities with UAV features like dynamic service provisioning in specific geographic areas. The proposed solution allows enforcing UAV security policies in proactive and reactive ways to automate UAV dynamic deployments and provisioning security Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) in the onboard Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) node. A UAV has been ensembled from scratch to validate the proposal, and a raspberry-pi has been onboarded as compute node. The implementation provides a VNF for dynamic UAV management, capable of dynamically loading waypoints into the flight controller to address reactive autonomous flights, and an ML-based VNF capable of detecting image patterns. According to the security policies, the onboard VNFs can be dynamically configured to generate alerts to the framework and apply local reactions depending on the detection made. In our experiments, we measured the time it takes for the solution to be ready after receiving a security policy for detecting patterns in a specific geographical area. The time it takes for the solution to react automatically was also measured. The results show that the proactive flow configuration considering ten waypoints can be enforced in less than 3 s, and a local reactive flow can be enforced in around 1 s. We consider that the results are promising and aligned with other security enabler solutions as part of existing 5G/6G security frameworks.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought a new era of interconnected devices and seamless data exchange. As the IoT ecosystem continues to expand, there is an increasing need for effective identity management mechanisms, specifically for authorization processes and access control. The pervasiveness of such devices demands that desirable solutions tackle not only security properties but also privacy aspects like granular control over which identity data is shared in authentication/authorization processes, covering aspects like bootstrapping, enrolment, and service provision. In this context, it is natural to turn to privacy-enhancing technologies, like (privacy-preserving) Attribute-Based Credentials (p-ABC), for achieving both high security and privacy guarantees. Nonetheless, these technical tools need to be accompanied by a comprehensive approach that deals with the particularities of IoT scenarios and covers the full lifetime of the device. In this work, we propose the use of a p-ABC scheme with support for distributed issuance (dp-ABC) as a keystone for privacy-preserving attribute-based authentication and authorization in IoT scenarios. We integrate said cryptographic scheme with W3C’s Verifiable Credentials standard, evaluating its impact to gauge its feasibility. The integration facilitates adoption and, particularly, allows the solution to transparently coexist with simpler techniques in heterogeneous scenarios that demand them. Moreover, we define and analyse a generic and comprehensive framework for identity management that identifies challenges throughout the device’s lifetime to achieve IoT privacy-preserving identity management following self-sovereign principles. We show how the various aspects identified in the framework are tackled in a concrete instantiation as part of the H2020 project ERATOSTHENES.}

This article explores the challenges of ensuring security in LPWANs and proposes a solution that combines two key mechanisms: Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) and Static Context Header Compression (SCHC). LPWANs are increasingly being used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, but the features that endow these technologies with low power consumption and long range also make it necessary to adapt protocols and innovate in the approaches to achieve security while maintaining communications viable in technologies like these, in some cases with severe limitations. OSCORE provides end-to-end security for constrained devices, while SCHC enables efficient IP-based transmission over LPWANs. By combining these two protocols, the proposed solution aims to address the security and efficiency challenges of LPWANs, ensuring that IoT devices and data are protected from unauthorized access and manipulation. The article also presents experimental results demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach using a real-life scenario, with industrial-grade hardware. The study concludes that the use of OSCORE and SCHC in LPWAN networks can significantly enhance the security and privacy of IoT devices.}

To cope with this issue, in this paper, we present an analysis of the privacy of different versions of the Chrome web browser. This analysis is based on the PrivacyScanner tool, which we have improved with the detection of additional tracking techniques. Our findings reveal that tracking protection has seen modest enhancements (namely, between Chrome version 83 and 90, we observed a 7.55% reduction in trackers and 4.76% decrease in Google Analytics elements).

  abstract={Applications where a person carries environmental sensors benefit from knowing the position of the individual. Researchers can locate the device by analyzing the radio signals used for sending information. However, it is necessary to know the impact of body obstruction on communication links and, therefore, on the localization system. The paper studies this impact by using field tests employing one LoRa node with an omnidirectional antenna in an outdoor parking lot with vegetation. The tests use four LoRa gateways located in the corners of the area to measure the signals with and without body obstruction. The node was located on the subject’s chest to maximize signal obstruction. Results show that signal strength decreases by an average of 3 dB on links with body shadowing. Additionally, the study uses these signals with machine learning and Kalman filter localization algorithms. Finally, the results show that body shadowing affects location accuracy in most methods. These results are useful for IoT researchers that need to locate people carrying LoRaWAN devices but cannot use GPS/GNSS due to energy constraints.},

abstract = {In recent years, the number of embedded computing devices connected to the Internet has exponentially increased. At the same time, new applications are becoming more complex and computationally demanding, which can be a problem for devices, especially when they are battery powered. In this context, the concepts of computation offloading and edge computing, which allow applications to be fully or partially offloaded and executed on servers close to the devices in the network, have arisen and received increasing attention. Then, the design of algorithms to make the decision of which applications or tasks should be offloaded, and where to execute them, is crucial. One of the options that has been gaining momentum lately is the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and, in particular, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), which enables learning optimal or near-optimal offloading policies adapted to each particular scenario. Although the use of RL techniques to solve the computation offloading problem in edge systems has been covered by some surveys, it has been done in a limited way. For example, some surveys have analysed the use of RL to solve various networking problems, with computation offloading being one of them, but not the primary focus. Other surveys, on the other hand, have reviewed techniques to solve the computation offloading problem, being RL just one of the approaches considered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that specifically focuses on the use of RL and DRL techniques for computation offloading in edge computing system. We present a comprehensive and detailed survey, where we analyse and classify the research papers in terms of use cases, network and edge computing architectures, objectives, RL algorithms, decision-making approaches, and time-varying characteristics considered in the analysed scenarios. In particular, we include a series of tables to help researchers identify relevant papers based on specific features, and analyse which scenarios and techniques are most frequently considered in the literature. Finally, this survey identifies a number of research challenges, future directions and areas for further study.}

abstract = {This paper describes the design and implementation of an OpenFlow software defined network (SDN) agent that manages and configures 10-gigabit-capable symmetric passive optical network (XGS-PON) architectures. Acting as an OpenFlow switch, the SDN agent communicates with an SDN controller using OpenFlow, while holding direct communication with the optical line terminal (OLT) through the chipset manufacturer-specific application programming interface, eliminating the need for emulating SDN layers in hardware devices. The proposal was evaluated through experiments conducted on a White Box XGS-PON OLT using the Open Network Operating System. The results demonstrate that the proposal facilitates a real-time SDN configuration of various Internet services, successfully fulfilling different quality of service requirements. Due to its ease of deployment, low complexity, smooth learning curve, scalability, and flexibility in integrating services, the proposal has significant potential. As a result, it offers a rapid SDN solution for configuring and testing new functionalities with minimal programming changes required in specific layers of the developed SDN agent.},

abstract = {Space division multiplexing (SDM) and band division multiplexing (BDM) are considered promising technologies to increase the capacity of optical transport networks. The progressive shortage of available dark fibers and the immaturity of multicore and multimode fibers for multichannel transmission induce network operators to postpone the process of capacity enhancement through SDM. Therefore, capacity increase revolves around BDM by lighting up at least the L-band of the already installed optical fiber infrastructure, which is a practical solution in the short to middle term. However, L-band activation requires the upgrade of network components such as erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs). To manage the imposed cost while leveraging the L-band, a network can be partially rather than fully migrated in a single step by upgrading just a subset of the fibers and thus a subset of EDFAs to operate in the C$+$L-bands. In this paper, the focus is set on determining which fibers in the network should be upgraded to exploit the L-band, subject to a constraint on the maximum number of EDFAs to be upgraded, and analyzing its impact on network performance when facing dynamic traffic in terms of the blocking ratio. To this end, three heuristic algorithms, each pursuing a different objective, and two of them based on an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation, are proposed for the network planning to identify which fibers to upgrade. Simulation results demonstrate that, thanks to the use of these heuristics, the upgrade of a partial set of links to the C$+$L line system is a viable solution for network operators to circumvent the huge cost associated with migrating the full network. For instance, we demonstrate that a strategic partial upgrade using the proposed methods, subject to upgrading a maximum of 60\% of the EDFAs, can significantly boost the supported traffic load in the examined topologies, ranging from 175\% to 322\%, when compared to the non-upgraded network.},

abstract = {Accurate environmental monitoring is becoming the basis for assuring sustainable development in administrations at different levels, including cities and industry as key actors. However, current techniques rely on static stations that may not be representative of larger areas, for the case of outdoor scenarios, or even not considering indoor spaces where people can remain for long periods. This is the case of vehicles. The COVID-19 pandemic has remarked the importance of measuring air quality indoors, for instance. With the aim of solving this two-fold issue, this work proposes an in-cabin and outdoor air pollution monitoring system to assure healthy conditions when travelling, driving and operating vehicles, and to analyse the evolution of environmental parameters in cities. This effort is carried out exploiting distributed computing with micro-services, betting for an on-board hardware solution provided with sensors for measuring particulate matter, CO, CO2, NO2, O3, temperature and humidity. While basic data pre-processing is carried out in this acquisition unit, edge processing is performed on a single board computer aboard and intermediary communication nodes in the network path from the vehicle to the cloud. Vehicle connectivity is provided by 4G cellular and Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWAN) networks. Global environmental perception is acquired by cloud-based software powered by machine learning and time series analysis. The whole solution has been validated and tested in the city of Cartagena (Spain), with good performance in terms of data collection, communication links and service offered.}

  abstract={The planning of multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems does not only consist in distributing MEC servers among the base stations (BSs) but also in designing the network to interconnect BSs, MEC resources and the wide area network (WAN) gateway. Due to their high bandwidth, fiber links are the best option for those connections in 5G environments. In contrast to previous works, which only solve the server placement problem, in this paper, an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation is proposed for solving both problems while reducing the installation cost (servers and fibers). The fiber deployment cost is especially important in sparsely populated areas as the distance between BSs are much longer than in urban environments. The model was tested using real BSs locations and population data showing that the formulation considerably reduces the installation cost.},

abstract = {Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) coherent optics using digital subcarrier multiplexing have recently been proposed as a promising new technology to reduce the cost and complexity of optical transport networks, particularly those in metro aggregation scenarios with hub-and-spoke (H\&S) traffic patterns. In this paper, we perform a case study on fault tolerant ring networks with more general traffic profiles to assess the benefits of P2MP optics for alternative network scenarios such as those appearing in metro rings. We propose mixed integer linear programming formulations for multilayer capacity planning to minimize total transceiver costs, considering both point-to-point and P2MP transceivers, as well as a heuristic approach for the more complex P2MP case. Results indicate that P2MP optics can bring several advantages for all tested traffic profiles, ranging from pure uniform flows to mostly H\&S. Transceiver cost savings are achieved in various cases, greater at higher network loads and for traffic patterns that are mostly H\&S. Results also show that P2MP optics prompt a multilayer redesign of the network with significantly reduced spectrum usage and a reduced number of IP hops, resulting in lower optical--electronic--optical and IP processing latency and lower IP layer equipment costs for all traffic profiles.},

ABSTRACT = {People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) need to monitor their blood glucose level frequently and use insulin to regulate it. T1D typically develops in young individuals and requires lifelong insulin injections for glycemic control. High or low blood glucose levels can lead to serious health issues. To address the challenges posed by regular monitoring and manual insulin injections, automated glucose control methods have been developed. Various insulin regimes are used to manage blood sugar levels, such as traditional regimes that involve one or two injections per day or multiple daily injection therapy, which offers more flexibility in the diet and dosage but still requires patients to monitor their carbohydrate intake and insulin injections. A proportional integral derivative (PID) controller is an automated glucose control method that is commonly used in commercial and research settings due to its simplicity and robustness. However, despite its effectiveness, this method can be affected by external factors like food, exercise, and illness. This study proposes to set an individualized observation frequency (OF) per user for the PID controller for blood glucose control in T1D. Optimizing the OF improves the PID controller’s performance, maintaining or elevating median glucose levels. Tuning the OF offers a simple and effective enhancement for the widely used PID controller.},

abstract = {Pollution in urban areas is turning into a primary focus for local governments in developed nations around the globe. Lots of data are currently collected for this from smart developments provided with atmospheric and climatic sensors. A hot research line is now exploiting such data to extract patterns and predict pollution levels in such a way that countermeasures can be taken beforehand and exposure to harmful concentrations is avoided. However, a key issue is the lack of significant data, due to incomplete smart infrastructures or calibration problems in sensors. Dealing with this, in this paper we propose the exploitation of synthetic data generation to enhance pollution prediction based on limited data sources, concretely extending real measurements of two weeks to up to ten extra years. We present a data generation approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a particular model focused on generating artificial pollution data, which is later exploited using different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Results indicate that the usage of synthetic data further improves prediction when used as the basis dataset to be later finetuned using real records. For 62% of pollutants this way to proceed in data mixing (among five different approaches) provides the best results in evaluations. Such effect is due to extra model robustness due to data regularization, and better generalization capabilities by avoiding sensor limitations in real deployments.}
