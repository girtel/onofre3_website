		Diabetes mellitus is a disease associated with abnormally high levels of
		blood glucose due to a lack of insulin. Combining an insulin pump and
		continuous glucose monitor with a control algorithm to deliver insulin is an
		alternative to patient self-management of insulin doses to control blood
		glucose levels in diabetes mellitus patients. In this work, we propose a
		closed-loop control for blood glucose levels based on deep reinforcement
		learning. We describe the initial evaluation of several alternatives
		conducted on a realistic simulator of the glucoregulatory system and propose
		a particular implementation strategy based on reducing the frequency of the
		observations and rewards passed to the agent, and using a simple reward
		function. We train agents with that strategy for three groups of patient
		classes, evaluate and compare it with alternative control baselines. Our
		results show that our method is able to outperform baselines as well as
		similar recent proposals, by achieving longer periods of safe glycemic state

		The significant increase in large-scale wildfire events in recent decades,
		caused primarily by climate change, has resulted in a growing number of
		aerial resources being used in suppression efforts. Present-day management
		lacks efficient and scalable algorithms for complex aerial resource
		allocation and scheduling for the extinction of such fires, which is crucial
		to ensuring safety while maximizing the efficiency of operations. In this
		work, we present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization model
		tailored to large-scale wildfires for the daily scheduling of aerial
		operations. The main objective is to achieve a prioritized target water flow
		over all areas of operation and all time periods. Minimal target completion
		across individual areas and time periods and total water output are also
		maximized as secondary and ternary objectives, respectively. An efficient and
		scalable multi-start heuristic, combining a randomized greedy approach with
		simulated annealing employing large neighborhood search techniques, is
		proposed for larger instances. A diverse set of problem instances is
		generated with varying sizes and extinction strategies to test the
		approaches. Results indicate that the heuristic can achieve (near)-optimal
		solutions for smaller instances solvable by the MILP, and gives solutions
		approaching target water flows for larger problem sizes. The algorithm is
		parallelizable and has been shown to give promising results in a small number
		of iterations, making it applicable for both night-before planning and, more
		time-sensitive, early-morning scheduling.

		Time series sensor data classification tasks often suffer from training data
		scarcity issue due to the expenses associated with the expert-intervened
		annotation efforts. For example, Electrocardiogram (ECG) data classification
		for cardio-vascular disease (CVD) detection requires expensive labeling
		procedures with the help of cardiologists. Current state-of-the-art
		algorithms like deep learning models have shown outstanding performance under
		the general requirement of availability of large set of training examples. In
		this paper, we propose Shapley Attributed Ablation with Augmented Learning:
		ShapAAL, which demonstrates that deep learning algorithm with suitably
		selected subset of the seen examples or ablating the unimportant ones from
		the given limited training dataset can ensure consistently better
		classification performance under augmented training. In ShapAAL, additive
		perturbed training augments the input space to compensate the scarcity in
		training examples using Residual Network (ResNet) architecture through
		perturbation-induced inputs, while Shapley attribution seeks the subset from
		the augmented training space for better learnability with the goal of better
		general predictive performance, thanks to the ``efficiency'' and ``null
		player'' axioms of transferable utility games upon which Shapley value game
		is formulated. In ShapAAL, the subset of training examples that contribute
		positively to a supervised learning setup is derived from the notion of
		coalition games using Shapley values associated with each of the given
		inputs' contribution into the model prediction. ShapAAL is a novel push-pull
		deep architecture where the subset selection through Shapley value
		attribution pushes the model to lower dimension while augmented training
		augments the learning capability of the model over unseen data. We perform
		ablation study to provide the empirical evidence of our claim and we show
		that proposed ShapAAL method consistently outperforms the current baselines
		and state-of-the-art algorithms for time series sensor data classification
		tasks from publicly available UCR time series archive that includes different
		practical important problems like detection of CVDs from ECG data.

		Climate change is increasing temperatures and causing periods of water
		scarcity in arid and semi-arid climates. The agricultural sector is one of
		the most affected by these changes, having to optimise scarce water
		resources. An important phenomenon within the water cycle is the evaporation
		from water reservoirs, which implies a considerable amount of water lost
		during warmer periods of the year. Indeed, evaporation rate forecasting can
		help farmers grow crops more sustainably by managing water resources more
		efficiently in the context of precision agriculture. In this work, we expose
		an interpretable machine learning approach, based on a multivariate decision
		tree, to forecast the evaporation rate on a daily basis using data from an
		Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, which is deployed on a real
		irrigated plot located in Murcia (southeastern Spain). The climate data
		collected feed the models that provide a forecast of evaporation and a
		summary of the parameters involved in this process. Finally, the results of
		the interpretable presented model are validated with the best literature
		models for evaporation rate prediction, i.e., Artificial Neural Networks,
		obtaining results very similar to those obtained for them, reaching up to
		0.85R2 and 0.6MAE. Therefore, in this work, a double objective is faced: to
		maintain the performance obtained by the models most frequently used in the
		problem while maintaining the interpretability of the knowledge captured in
		it, which allows better understanding the problem and carrying out
		appropriate actions.

		The temperature of indoor spaces is at the core of highly relevant topics

		The electric grid is undertaking a change of paradigm. New requirements such
		as the high power loads of Electric Vehicles' charging are putting pressure
		on grids, and the popularisation of the figure of the prosumers, are creating
		new needs on the management of the system. Although the investment on
		infrastructure is one of the ways of alleviating the arrival of this new
		loads, the existence of smart controls, actuators and smart appliances opens
		also the door for demand modification. The so called Demand Response Events
		are strategies to reallocate the loads of the consumers, so the power demand
		is shifted towards times less critical for the grid. Some smart appliances
		can be considered as shiftable. The operation of them can be rescheduled to
		other times and still provide their services. On this paper we suggest an
		optimisation methodology consisting on a parallelisation method together with

		With the ongoing fifth-generation cellular network (5G) deployment,

		measurements are scarce, and accurate electromagnetic field reconstruction in
		a geographic region remains challenging. This work proposes a conditional

		to reconstruct the electromagnetic field exposure map accurately according to
		the environment\&rsquo;s topology from a few sensors located in an outdoor
		urban environment. The model is trained to learn and estimate the propagation
		characteristics of the electromagnetic field according to the topology of a

		Results show that the proposed method produces accurate estimates and is a

		Future generations of mobile networks will require increased backhaul
		capacity to connect a massive amount of small cells (SCs) to the network.
		Since having an optical connection to each SC might be infeasible, mmWave
		links are an interesting alternative due to their large available bandwidth.
		An advantage of a wireless backhaul is that the topology can be reconfigured
		to adapt to changing traffic demands, new operator policies, or to rapidly
		overcome network failures. In this work, we investigate the problem of
		orchestrating the reconfiguration of mmWave wireless backhaul networks with
		mechanically steerable antennas assuming green backhaul operation where nodes
		are turned off when not in use. The orchestration involves scheduling and
		coordinating the powering on/off of nodes, the rotation of antennas to
		achieve alignment for link establishment, and setting up and tearing down
		links to minimize packet loss during the reconfiguration. We model the
		problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) for optimal orchestration
		and propose a sub-optimal reduced MILP for larger instances. Numerical
		results for different topologies using a realistic traffic trace indicate
		that optimizing reconfiguration orchestration can significantly reduce packet
		loss in comparison to a straightforward reconfiguration approach, enabling a
		smooth transition between target mmWave backhaul topologies.

		Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) coherent optics using digital subcarrier
		multiplexing have recently been proposed as a promising new technology to
		reduce the cost and complexity of optical transport networks, particularly
		those in metro aggregation scenarios with hub-and-spoke (H\&S) traffic
		patterns. In this paper, we perform a case study on fault tolerant ring

		optics for alternative network scenarios such as those appearing in metro
		rings. We propose mixed integer linear programming formulations for
		multilayer capacity planning to minimize total transceiver costs, considering
		both point-to-point and P2MP transceivers, as well as a heuristic approach
		for the more complex P2MP case. Results indicate that P2MP optics can bring
		several advantages for all tested traffic profiles, ranging from pure uniform
		flows to mostly H\&S. Transceiver cost savings are achieved in various cases,
		greater at higher network loads and for traffic patterns that are mostly
		H\&S. Results also show that P2MP optics prompt a multilayer redesign of the
		network with significantly reduced spectrum usage and a reduced number of IP
		hops, resulting in lower optical--electronic--optical and IP processing
		latency and lower IP layer equipment costs for all traffic profiles.

		In vehicular communications, the increase of the channel load caused by

		beaconing rate control problem as a Markov Decision Process and solve it
		using approximate reinforcement learning to carry out optimal actions.
		Results obtained were compared with other traditional solutions, revealing
		that our approach, called SSFA, is able to keep a certain fraction of the
		channel capacity available, which guarantees the delivery of
		emergency-related notifications with faster convergence than other proposals.
		Moreover, good performance was obtained in terms of packet delivery and

		Telecom operators' infrastructure is sustained by optical communication

		advancements unlocked unprecedented transmission capacities,
		reconfigurability and programmability, entailing an evolution in the way

		The adoption of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP-WAN) for interconnecting
		remote wireless sensors has become a reality in smart scenarios, covering
		communications needs of large Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. The
		correct operation and expected performance of such network scenarios, which
		can range hundreds or thousands of nodes and tens of squared kilometres,
		should be assessed before carrying out the deployment to save installation
		and maintenance costs. Common network planning tools can help to roughly
		study potential coverage, but network simulation offers fine-grained
		information about network performance. Nevertheless, current simulation
		frameworks include limited propagation models based on statistical and
		empirical measurements that do not consider scenario particularities, such as
		terrain elevation, buildings or vegetation. This is critical in urban
		settings. In this line, this paper presents a simulation framework including
		a network simulator, a 3D engine and a ray-tracing tool, which models
		realistically the performance of Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN)
		communication technology. We have evaluated the performance of the solution
		taking as reference experimental campaigns in the city of Cartagena (Spain),
		comparing data obtained when simulating with the commonly employed
		propagation models such as Okumura–Hata or path loss. Results indicate that
		our framework, set-up with data from open geographical information systems,
		accurately fits experimental values, reporting improvements between 10\% and
		50\% in the error committed when estimating signal strength in challenging
		urban streets with signal obstruction, as compared with the better performing
		classical model, Okumura–Hata.

abstract = {The digitalization of cities and the development of smart, green, and integrated transport are societal challenges to transform cities into places with good quality of life now and in the future. The Internet of Things (IoT) comes with new advances to connect a multitude of sensing devices and even actuators, and they are presenting the cornerstone of Smart City deployments worldwide. So far, these advances have focused on static sensors in scenarios such as gardens, smart lighting, climate monitoring, or traffic management. However, moving sensors could rise the monitoring capabilities of smart cities to the next level, helping to better reflect the status of large areas without replicating fixed stations. This work proposes taking advantage of urban vehicles and, especially, personal mobility vehicles (PMVs), to implement such a perspective. Hence, a low-cost and energy-aware onboard unit (OBU) is designed to gather environmental data and support sustainable mobility applications. This on-board platform is provided with Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) communication technologies, enabling an Internet connection following an IoT scheme. The unit is equipped with sensors to measure air pollution in terms of NO2, CO, SO2, O3 and PMx, noise, and weather parameters. While moving across the city, PMVs mounting this device can collect data in a crowdsensing scheme. This data feed is complemented by a set of wireless traffic sensors, and they are subject to intelligent processing to monitor pollution and mobility parameters. For this, a back-end software module is powered with temporal series analysis to generate predictions based on tendencies detected in both pollution and mobility values. A front-end Web application has been implemented to show all past, current, and predicted data, offering functionalities to monitor urban mobility, minimize travel times, detect pollution areas, and recommend healthy routes across streets with low contamination levels.}

abstract = {Accurate environmental monitoring is becoming the basis for assuring sustainable development in administrations at different levels, including cities and industry as key actors. However, current techniques rely on static stations that may not be representative of larger areas, for the case of outdoor scenarios, or even not considering indoor spaces where people can remain for long periods. This is the case of vehicles. The COVID-19 pandemic has remarked the importance of measuring air quality indoors, for instance. With the aim of solving this two-fold issue, this work proposes an in-cabin and outdoor air pollution monitoring system to assure healthy conditions when travelling, driving and operating vehicles, and to analyse the evolution of environmental parameters in cities. This effort is carried out exploiting distributed computing with micro-services, betting for an on-board hardware solution provided with sensors for measuring particulate matter, CO, CO2, NO2, O3, temperature and humidity. While basic data pre-processing is carried out in this acquisition unit, edge processing is performed on a single board computer aboard and intermediary communication nodes in the network path from the vehicle to the cloud. Vehicle connectivity is provided by 4G cellular and Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWAN) networks. Global environmental perception is acquired by cloud-based software powered by machine learning and time series analysis. The whole solution has been validated and tested in the city of Cartagena (Spain), with good performance in terms of data collection, communication links and service offered.}

  abstract={Mobile networks are facing an unprecedented demand for high-speed connectivity originating from novel mobile applications and services and, in general, from the adoption curve of mobile devices. However, coping with the service requirements imposed by current and future applications and services is very difficult since mobile networks are becoming progressively more heterogeneous and more complex. In this context, a promising approach is the adoption of novel network automation solutions and, in particular, of zero-touch management techniques. In this work, we refer to zero-touch management as a fully autonomous network management solution with human oversight. This survey sits at the crossroad between zero-touch management and mobile and wireless network research, effectively bridging a gap in terms of literature review between the two domains. In this paper, we first provide a taxonomy of network management solutions. We then discuss the relevant state-of-the-art on autonomous mobile networks. The concept of zero-touch management and the associated standardization efforts are then introduced. The survey continues with a review of the most important technological enablers for zero-touch management. The network automation solutions from the RAN to the core network, including end-to-end aspects such as security, are then surveyed. Finally, we close this article with the current challenges and research directions.},
