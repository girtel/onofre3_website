On December 11th, 2024, the fourth plenary meeting of the project took place at the UVA facilities, bringing together representatives from UPCT, UVA, UMU, and I2Cat. The meeting agenda covered a review of the project’s main objectives and tasks, an overview of the key progress achieved by the four participating institutions, and several technical sessions featuring specific research contributions. This event provided an opportunity to address the last months of the project and prepare the forthcoming final justification. The last implementation, testing and dissemination tasks were discussed, together with future lines that will be left for the recently approved ONOFRE-4. These novel lines can be found within the areas of Time-sensitive 6G networks; connecting next-generation OBUs in challenging networking scenarios; guaranteed quality of service using SLA enforcement and efficient radio access; and SDN-based optical core networks, among others.
