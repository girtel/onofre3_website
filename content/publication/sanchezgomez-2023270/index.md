abstract: The expansion of the Internet of Moving Things (IoMT) leads to limitless
  and continuous working playgrounds exploited by highly dynamic end devices. This
  requires the adoption of multi-Radio Access Technologies (RATs)-based strategies
  to provide IoMT units with ubiquitous connectivity. To this end, the development
  of secure bootstrapping and authentication mechanisms is necessary to permit the
  secure operation of end devices. Given the transmission and power limitations of
  these elements, current cryptographic solutions do not address these stringent requirements.
  For that reason, in the study we present a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC)-based
  end-to-end architecture that enables an efficient and secure authentication and
  key agreement between end devices and network servers over heterogeneous resource-limited
  networks such as the Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). Our proposal is based
  on the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) architecture and the
  recent Internet Engineering Task Force initiatives Static Context Header Compression
  and Low-Overhead CoAP-EAP. The results obtained from experimental tests reveal the
  validity of the proposal as it enables constrained IoMT devices to gain IPv6 connectivity
  as well as performs end-to-end secure authentication with notable reliability and
  controlled latency.
