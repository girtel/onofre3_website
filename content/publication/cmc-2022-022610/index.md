abstract: A new wave of electric vehicles for personal mobility is currently crowding
  public spaces. They offer a sustainable and efficient way of getting around in urban
  environments, however, these devices bring additional safety issues, including serious
  accidents for riders. Thereby, taking advantage of a connected personal mobility
  vehicle, we present a novel on-device Machine Learning (ML)-based fall detection
  system that analyzes data captured from a range of sensors integrated on an on-board
  unit (OBU) prototype. Given the typical processing limitations of these elements,
  we exploit the potential of the TinyML paradigm, which enables embedding powerful
  ML algorithms in constrained units. We have generated and publicly released a large
  dataset, including real riding measurements and realistically simulated falling
  events, which has been employed to produce different TinyML models. The attained
  results show the good operation of the system to detect falls efficiently using
  embedded OBUs. The considered algorithms have been successfully tested on mass-market
  low-power units, implying reduced energy consumption, flash footprints and running
  times, enabling new possibilities for this kind of vehicles.
